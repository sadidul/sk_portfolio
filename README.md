# Sadidul Kabir - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, this is Sadidul Kabir. I'm a passionate data analyst who has extensive experience transforming data into insights and workable solutions. I have the experience to take on challenging issues and provide insightful solutions that will propel business success. I have a solid background in data analysis, exploratory data analysis, reports, and data visualization.
I have worked in a wide range of businesses, including technology, healthcare, finance, and retail. My expertise includes manipulating and analyzing huge data sets utilizing tools like SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python and related libraries, as well as presenting results in PowerBI in an understandable and engaging way.
I am a self-starter who prefers working alone, but I also work well in a team and am most productive in a collaborative setting. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
