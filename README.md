# Sadidul Kabir - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, this is Sadidul Kabir. I'm a passionate data analyst who has extensive experience transforming data into insights and workable solutions. I have the experience to take on challenging issues and provide insightful solutions that will propel business success. I have a solid background in data analysis, exploratory data analysis, reports, and data visualization.

I have worked in a wide range of businesses, including technology, healthcare, finance, and retail. My expertise includes manipulating and analyzing huge data sets utilizing tools like SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python and related libraries, as well as presenting results in PowerBI in an understandable and engaging way.

I am a self-starter who prefers working alone, but I also work well in a team and am most productive in a collaborative setting. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list Data Analytics and Data Science projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Dhaka Weather Analysis (1953-2016)
**Code:** [`1953-2016 Dhaka Weather Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/sadidul/Data_Analysis_Project/blob/main/1953-2016%20Dhaka%20Weather%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** The data set we will use for data analysis is Dhaka weather data from 1953 to 2016.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of weather which was collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. The dataset included YEAR, Month, MaxTemp, MinTemp, RelativeHumidity, Rainfall, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, statistical analysis, data visualization and finding insights.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** 
1. Jun, July and August are most Rainy Months
2. April, May, Jun and July are most Max Temprature Months
3. December, January and February are most Min Temprature Months
4. Jun, July and August has Highly Relative Humidity
5. Rainfall & Humidity are highly Correlated


### Predicting CO2 emission using ML Regression Models
**Code:** [`linear_regression_predict_carbon-dioxide emissions.ipynb`](https://github.com/sadidul/Data_Analysis_Project/blob/main/linear_regression_predict_carbon-dioxide%20emissions.ipynb)

**Goal:** The data set we will use for predicting CO2 emission using Linear Regression Model.

**Description:** The dataset contains data on the engine size, number of cylinders, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide gas emissions of some vehicles. Assume that carbon-dioxide emissions are the target variable in this dataset; that is, given the engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption of a new car, you want to predict the car's carbon-dioxide emissions.

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, LinearRegression model, statsmodels and so on .

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.

**Results:** The model can predict 89% accurately. We can use this model to predict CO2 emissions by making new observations.
